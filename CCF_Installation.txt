Getting started with CCF using CGRAs of varying size
	1. go to scripts directory
		a. changes to map.sh
			line 7 | toolchain = (location where ccf is installed)
			
		b. changes to opt.sh
			line 8 | toolchain = (location where ccf is installed)
			
	2. go to scripts/CGRALib directory
		a. changes to cgra.c
			line 69 | change 16 to x dimension * y dimension
			line 70 | ""
			line 71 | ""
			alternatively, add "#define CGRA_Size XXX" for simplicity
			
		b. changes to cgracc
			line 8 | toolchain = (location where ccf is installed)
			
		c. changes to run.sh
			line 15 | X = (desired CGRA X dimension)
			line 16 | Y = (desired CGRA Y dimension)
			line 23 | toolchain = (location where ccf is installed)
			Don't try changing the size of R. It's hardcoded all over Gem5
			
	3. go to InstructionGenerator directory
		a. changes to CGRAdefinitions.h
			line 18 | CGRA_XDim (desired CGRA X dimension)
			line 19 | CGRA_YDim (desired CGRA Y dimension)
			
	4. go to gem5/src/cpu/atomiccgra directory
		a. changes to CGRAdefinitions.h
			line 24 | CGRA_XDim (desired CGRA X dimension)
			line 25 | CGRA_YDim (desired CGRA Y dimension)
			
	5. go to gem5/src/cpu/timingcgra directory
		a. changes to CGRAdefinitions.h
			line 17 | CGRA_XDim (desired CGRA X dimension)
			line 18 | CGRA_YDim (desired CGRA Y dimension)
			
	6. go to home ccf directory
		a. changes to install
			comment out lines 11, 75, 76
			
	7. go to work/benchmarks/MiBench/basicmath-CCF/basicmath13
		a. changes to Makefile
			line 7 | change to "CC = ../../../../../scripts/CGRALib/cgracc"
			make this change for all Makefiles
			
		b. changes to runme_small.sh
			line 4 | change to the correct location of gem5 for gem5.opt and se_hetero.py
			make this change for all run scripts
		
		c. changes to basicmath_small.c
			comment out lines 21 though 57
			comment out lines 77 though 81
			line 61 | change 1001 to 101
			These changes are optional but make the program run faster
